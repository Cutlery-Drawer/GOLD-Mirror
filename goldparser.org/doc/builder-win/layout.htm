<h1>Application Layout</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The flow of the application is broken down into three distinct steps that progress from
a grammar to the completed parse tables. The developer advances by clicking the
&quot;Next&quot; button which is located on the bottom left side of the main window. This
is similar to the interface commonly used by installation software and application
&quot;wizards&quot;. </p>

<h2>Next Button</h2>

<p>The Next Button will change each time it is clicked - representing the next step in
compilation process. </p>

  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign="top" class="ssListItemCell"><strong>Step 1</strong></td>
    <td valign="top" class="ssListItemCell"><strong>Enter the Grammar</strong><p>During this
    step, the Builder checks the syntax of the grammar itself and prepares the system to
    compute the parse tables. If the grammar contains an error, it is reported to the user and
    the system resets. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign="top" class="ssListItemCell"><strong>Step 2</strong></td>
    <td valign="top" class="ssListItemCell"><strong>Compute the Parser</strong><p>During this
    step, the Builder attempts to construct the LALR Parser tables. Most conflicts occur
    during the construction of the LALR parse tables, and, as a result, these are constructed
    first. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign="top" class="ssListItemCell"><strong>Step 3</strong></td>
    <td valign="top" class="ssListItemCell"><strong>Compute the Tokenizer</strong><p>During
    this step, the Builder attempts to DFA tables used by the tokenizer (scanner). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign="top" class="ssListItemCell"><strong>Step 4</strong></td>
    <td valign="top" class="ssListItemCell"><strong>Save the Compiled Grammar</strong><p>If no
    problems are found, the developer now has the ability to save the parse information to a
    Compiled Grammar Table file. If the developer clicks on the button at this point, the
    system will automatically display the &quot;Save File&quot; dialog window.Since the parse
    tables are complete and ready to use, the developer has the ability to interactively test
    the grammar using the embedded parser engine. Also, the developer can export the grammar
    to different file formats (besides Compiled Grammar Table files), and create skeleton
    programs. </td>
