    <td valign="top">One of the primary goals of the GOLD Parsing System is to support any
    number of programming languages. To accomplish this, the logic used to construct parse
    tables is logically removed from the algorithms that do the actual parsing. <p>When a
    grammar is analyzed by the GOLD Builder, parse tables are constructed for the
    Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and LALR algorithms. Both the <a href="../about/dfa.htm">DFA</a> and <a href="../about/lalr.htm">LALR</a> algorithms are
    simple automatas, and can be easily implemented in different programming languages with a
    minimum of code. The Engine has already been implemented in Visual Basic, C++, C#, ANSI C,
    Java and Delphi.</p>
    <p>Once the parse tables are constructed, they can be saved to an Enhanced Grammar Tables
    file (.egt). This file is platform and programming language independent. As a result,
    different implementations of the Engine can load the file and use its information.</p>
    <p>This documentation contains information on the EGT file format and contents.</td>
