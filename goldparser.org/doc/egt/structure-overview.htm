<h1>File Structure Overview</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>First, it is important to differentiate between the file's <em>format</em> and the
file's <em>content</em>. When a document is saved to a file (for instance, a Microsoft
Word file) it can be later retrieved and the work continued. This is possible since the
application knows how information is stored and can, therefore, read its contents
reliably. On the other hand, the actual <em>content</em> of the document can differ
greatly from one file to the next (i.e. a report on Sacramento to an essay on parsing
techniques).</p>

<p>This section describes the file format used. This documentation also contains a
description of the Compiled Grammar Table file's <a href="record-overview.htm">content</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Structures</h2>

<p>The file format is rather simple:</p>

<p><img height="33" src="images/structure-file.png" width="439"></p>

<p>The first data structure in the file is the File Header which contains a
null-terminated <a href="../about/unicode.htm">Unicode</a> string. This string contains
the the name and version of the type of information stored in the files records. In the
case of a Compiled Grammar Table file, the file will contain the text:</p>
<table class="ssCodeTable">
	<tr>
		<td class="ssCodeTableBody" >
		<p>GOLD Parser Tables/5.0</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>

<p>Since this string is stored in <a href="../about/unicode.htm">Unicode</a> format, there
are two bytes per each character give a total size of&nbsp; (22+1)*2 = 46 bytes. The
header should be read as any normal Unicode string, since its size could change depending
its contents.</p>

<p>Following the Unicode string that consists the Header, the file will contain one or
more <a href="structure-record.htm">records</a>. </p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2>

<p>The file format used to save the Enhanced Grammar Tables was based on 
following principles: 

<ol>
  <li>The file should be closely related to the previous &quot;Compiled Grammar 
  Table&quot; format.</li>
	<li>The file will normally be written to only once (when created) then then only read from
    sequentially</li>
  <li>The amount of information saved to the file will not be enormous, so data storage
    overhead is not an issue.</li>
  <li>The format should be easy to implement on numerous platforms. In other words, to be very
    simple structurally.</li>
  <li>The file structure should allow data structures to be added or expanded as needed in the
    future.</li>
  <li>The file structure should allow addition types of records to be added, if needed.</li>
</ol>
