<h1>File Structure: Records</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each logical record starts with a byte containing the value 77. This is the ASCII code
for the letter &quot;M&quot;, which, in turn, stands for <u>m</u>ultitype. So far, this is
the only type of record stored in the file; however, it is possible, in the future, to add
more types such as pictures, sounds, additional parse information, and other files. </p>

<p>Following the first byte, there is a two byte unsigned integer that contains the total
number of entries in the record. The number is stored in <a href="../about/byte-ordering.htm">Little Endian</a> format, which means the least
significant byte is stored first. This is the format used on the Intel family of
processors and is the standard used by most file formats. Also, please note, this value is
<u>not</u> the number of bytes to follow, but instead the number of different data types
are stored. You should implement a simple &quot;for-loop&quot; to read the entries from
the file.</p>

<p>Each multitype row can contain any assortment of Boolean, Byte, Empty, Integer, and
String <a href="sdb-entry-overview.htm">entries</a>. In future implementations of this
file format, more entry types can be created.</p>
