<h1>Reduction Object</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>When the parsing engine has read enough tokens to conclude a <a href="object-rule.htm">rule</a>
in the grammar is complete, it is 'reduced' and passed to the developer. Basically a
'reduction'&nbsp; will contain the tokens which correspond to the symbols of the rule.
Tokens can represent actual data read from the file (a.k.a. terminals), but also may
contain objects as well. Since a reduction contains the terminals of a rule as well as the
nonterminals (reductions made earlier), the parser engine creates a 'parse tree' &nbsp;
which contains a break down of the source text along the grammar's rules.</p>

<p>Essentially, when a reduction takes place, the <a href="object-goldparser.htm">GOLDParser</a>
object will respond with the gpMsgReduce message, create a new Reduction object, and then
store it in the CurrentReduction property. This property can be read and then reassigned
to another object if you decide to create your own objects. However, this is not required
since the parse tree will be created using the produced Reduction.</p>

<p>The Reduction object is designed to be general purpose - able to store any rule, but at
a cost. Since it is general purpose, there is additional overhead required that would not
be needed in a specialized object. Invariably there will be numerous instances of the
Reduction object, so it was was designed to use as little memory as possible while
maintaining basic functionality.</p>
