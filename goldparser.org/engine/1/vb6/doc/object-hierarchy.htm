<h1>Object Hierarchy</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Visual Basic 6 implementation of the Engine contains five different objects which
are used to represent information stored in the Compiled Grammar Table file and
information created at parse time. The main functionality of the parser is performed by
the GOLDParser Object. This object contains both the Rule Table and Symbol Table. To
represent this information, the Symbol and Rule Objects were created. </p>

<p>During parse time, the GOLDParser Object will create instances of Reduction and Token
Objects. The Reduction Object contains a series of tokens and is associated with the
reduced rule. Each Token is associated with the corresponding symbol in the reduced rule.</p>
