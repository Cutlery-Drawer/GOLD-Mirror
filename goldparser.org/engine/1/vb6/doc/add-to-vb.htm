  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">The GOLD Parser Engine DLL is not an ActiveX<sup>®</sup>
    control, and, as a result, it is not added to your project as you would other controls.
    Instead, the DLL is a library containing the objects needed to create your parser.<p>To
    add the GOLD Parser Engine DLL to your project, you must add it to your project's
    &quot;references&quot;. </p>
    <p>To do this, first select &quot;References&quot; from the Project Menu.</td>

<p>Visual Basic now displays a list of libraries available to add to your project. The
Engine DLL is included with the Builder, but it is not installed into the Windows<sup>®</sup>
Operating System. As a result, it will not be displayed on the list. Click on
&quot;Browse&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Engine DLL that came with the Builder will be located in the same folder as the
&quot;GOLD Parser Builder.exe&quot;. This is normally located in the following folder:</p>

<table class="ssChartTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" class="ssChartTableBodyItem"><tt>C:\Program Files\GOLD Parser Builder</tt></td>
  </tr>

<p><img src="images/ss-vb5-reference3.gif" alt="ss-vb5-reference3.gif (7602 bytes)" WIDTH="426" HEIGHT="292"></p>

<p>Click on &quot;Open&quot; and all the GOLD Parser Objects will be added to your
project.</p>
