        just released</p>
        <p>This release fixes a few minor bugs - mostly annoying - and adds a couple of useful
        editor features.<ul>
          <li>Added an indent and unindent editor feature. These two editor features allow you
            increase and decrease the indent of the selected text.</li>
          <li>Added an 'auto align' editor feature. Most definitions can contain multiple lines. This
            feature will align each '|' to the corresponding '::=' or '-'.</li>
          <li>Some internal variables were changed from 16-bit integers to 32-bit integers. </li>
          <li>The LALR State Browser was modified slightly. The LALR State Browser will display
            conflict information in both the Actions Tab and Configurations Tab.b.</li>
          <li>Fixed the focus bug in the Test Window. When a 'parse action' was double-clicked, the
            system was not setting the focus in the text window.</li>
          <li>The Test Window is now reset with the rest of the system. Before, the Test Window would
            retain any parse information even if the system was 'reset'. This allowed information to
            be displayed that would differ from the grammar. </li>

        slightly</p>
        <p>I made some changes to the tables used in the website. These changes were designed to
        circumvent bugs in the FireFox browser.<ul>
          <li>It has trouble rendering a page with a FORM tag. In particular, the metrics for cell
            padding and margins do not work correctly.</li>
          <li>Also, the border-collapse feature of cascading style sheets yields rather strange
            results. The website now gets same visual effects without using that feature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the exception of these two problems, Firefox is an excellent browser.</td>

        <td class="ssListDescCell"><p class="ssListHeaderText">Version 3.0.1 of the Builder was
        released!</p>
        <p>This is a minor release. Most of the modifications are to the user interface. <ul>
          <li>The toolbar icons were updated. I wrote a really simple program that gave each icon
            minor shading. As a result, the new icons have a slight '3D' look and, consequently, are
            far more appealing than the previous set. The icon used for 'Help' was also replaced with
            the blue-circle symbol that is becoming the standard.</li>
          <li>The footer in the Test Window was improved. When the user clicks on a parse action,
            details are displayed in the bottom of the window. If there was a large amount of text, it
            could not be displayed in the space provided. The window not will automatically display a
            scrollbar if this happens.</li>
          <li>The grammar created by the Grammar Wizard was modified slightly. The horizontal tab is
            often allowed in string literals. However, the string definition created by Wizard did not
            include it.</li>
          <li>The 'Tip of the Day' Window is now an MDI child. </li>
          <li>Fixed an 'overflow bug' in the Test Window. In cases where the test file was large, an
            'overflow' error would occur. This happened when the system was ready to display the parse
            tree.</li>

        <p>In version 3.0 of the Builder, the &quot;character mapping&quot; parameter was modified
        to accept either 'Unicode' or 'Windows-1252'. Beforehand, the developer would specify
        'ANSI' to map the characters from the Windows-1252 character set. This change was designed

        Update!</span> Version 3.0 of the Builder was released!<ul>
          <li><strong>Major Update!</strong> The user interface was completely overhauled! Prior
            versions of the Builder used a GUI library that I wrote a long time ago. Although I
            thought it looked good on Windows 95, 98, etc... it looks quite odd on XP systems. This
            change also makes the application considerably 'lighter' than the last version.</li>
          <li>The main toolbar was redesigned. By adopting the standard toolbar and coolbar controls,
            I have been able to add more icons to the application.</li>
          <li>The message section, which displays the current step, was redesigned. An icon was added
            that represents the current step. The accompanying description was also changed.</li>
          <li>Some helpful, recently used, folders are now remembered between sessions. The folders
            that were used save skeleton programs, load test information, and save test results are
            stored for later use. </li>
          <li>Changed the 'ANSI' parameter setting to 'Windows-1252'. Developers can still specify
            'ANSI' for the Character Mapping parameter. Both are treated the same.</li>
          <li>The application's icon was changed. The new version is more 'golden' and contains a
            faint outline of Tower Bridge. </li>
          <li>Fixed a character constant bug. Terminal definitions were not properly handling
            character constants. Thanks to Dan Ullfig for reporting this bug.</li>

        <p>The GOLD Engine can be implemented in any general-purpose programming language.
        However, sometimes understanding the algorithms can be difficult. The Pseudo-Code

        Version 2.6.5 of the Builder was released!</p>
        <p>The new version of the Builder mostly contains enhancements to the GUI and tools. The
        changes include the following:<ul>
          <li>Added a 'comment' and 'uncomment' editor feature. These two features will add/remove the
            ! symbol from the start of each selected line. Buttons were also added to the main
            toolbar. The Meta-Language still supports block comments using !* .. *!.</li>
          <li>Redesigned the LALR State Browser. The window now contains three tabs. The first two
            tabs contain information that was previously available - namely configurations and
            actions. The 'new' third tab contains all the 'prior states' that advance to the current
            state. This allows the developer to trace backwards - which was very difficult before.</li>
          <li>The 'Export to Webpage' window was revamped. The developer can now save their customized
            color schemes. Beforehand, each color scheme was 'hard-wired' into the system. In
            addition, some new color schemes were created based on a different colors.</li>

          <li>The developer can now double-click on Test Window items. If the developer double-clicks
            on 'Token Read', the system will jump to the corresponding line in the test window. Also,
            if the developer double-clicks on a shift or reduce, the system will open the LALR State
            Browser.</li>
          <li>The icons in the Test Window were improved. The new icons are designed to be a tad
            simplier and easier to recognize. I still haven't figured out a good picture to use for
            reductions. For now, the 'box' icon is still used.</li>

        Version 2.6.2 of the Builder was released<ul>
          <li><strong>Fixed a bug in the LALR table construction algorithm</strong>. The bug occurred
            in the 'partial closures' that are created before the LALR states are computed. In rare
            cases, configurations were not set to 'inherit' lookahead symbols from the spawning state.
            This resulted in parse errors even though the source text and grammar were correct. This
            bug only affected versions 2.6 and 2.61 of the Builder. Even though the bug is rare, it is
            recommended that you recompile your grammars.</li>

        Version 2.6.1 of the Builder was released<ul>
          <li><strong>Added some additional grammar checks</strong>. The checks are designed to find
            flaws in grammars before the system attempts to create the LALR parser and DFA tokenizer.
            The first test checks if rules are both left AND right recursive. The second checks for
            rules in the form <span class="ssCodeText">&lt;A&gt; ::= &lt;A&gt;</span>. Both cases will
            always cause a shift-reduce error.</li>
          <li><strong>The LALR construction algorithm was improved</strong>. The algorithm now uses a
            different tree traversal method than before. In addition, some additional, temporary,
            tables were created to improve efficiency.</li>
          <li>Fixed a character constant bug. I made a couple quick changes before version 2.6 was

        <td class="ssListDescCell"><p class="ssListHeaderText"><span class="ssAttention">Major
        Update!</span> Version 2.6 of the Builder was released</p>
        <p>The new version of the Builder contains a large number of improvements. These include
        both the efficiency of the system, the GUI interface and the GOLD Meta-Language itself.</p>
        <p>The new version contains (but is not limited to)&nbsp; the following changes:<ul>
          <li><strong>Huge Addition! Set ranges were added to the GOLD Meta-Language</strong>. Set
            ranges allow the developer to specify a large range of characters. Beforehand, developers
            had to rely on the predefined sets or manually add each character of the range to a set
            definition. Needless to say, this could be quite tedious. In addition, some predefined
            sets were also added that include large sections of the Unicode Character Set.</li>
          <li><strong>Major Update! The DFA table construction algorithm was reengineered</strong>.
            The new version is faster and able to handle huge character sets.</li>
          <li><strong>Update! The LALR table construction algorithm was improved</strong>. The
            algorithm now computes all the nonterminal configuration set closures before building the
            LALR state table.</li>
          <li>The 'Import a YACC Grammar Wizard' was reengineered. The new version is better able to
            handle grammars with embedded C/C++ source code. Beforehand, the system was able to import
            a grammar only if the C code followed the rule. This new version, however, tolerates C
            code appearing anywhere in the rule. It is also better able to handle YACC precedence
            levels.</li>
          <li>Added a set literal warning. Sometimes, developers use YACC-like notation for set
            literals such as [A-Z]. However, the GOLD Builder only interprets this as the three
            characters: 'A', '-', and 'Z'. I had previously added this warning to when sets were being
            defined, but failed to add it when set literals are used directly in terminal definitions.</li>
          <li>The Grammar Editor window and the Test Window now display the current column number. </li>
          <li>Fixed the 'format paste' bug. Often when text was copied and pasted into the grammar
            editor, the text's color, font and size were also copied.</li>
          <li>DFA State Browser now refreshes on reset. The DFA State Browser was not resetting the
            displayed data if the system was reset. As a result, the system would show the last viewed
            state although it did not exist.</li>
          <li>Fixed the z-order for the Find and Replace windows. Sometimes, the Find and Replace
            windows could be hidden behind other windows. If the user attempted to display the
            windows, it would not jump to the front of the z-order.</li>

        Version 2.5.4 of the Builder was released</p>
        <p>The new version includes the following changes:<ul>
          <li><strong>The YACC Import Utility is now a wizard</strong>. The new 'YACC Import Wizard'
            gives the user more control over the how the new grammar is generated. This includes the
            formatting of rules and how rule names are converted.</li>
          <li>Some changes were made to the preset color themes in 'Export To Web Page' utility. The
            colors of the 'Humboldt' theme and 'Default' theme were improved. In addition, a new theme
            called 'California Republic' was added. This theme is based on the colors of the flag.</li>
          <li>Made some modifications to the log. If a shift-reduce conflict is fixed, the log will
            now display the name of the token that caused the conflict.</li>
          <li>The 'C (ANSI) - Defines' program template was updated. <a href="../contributors/index.htm">Justin Holmes</a> created a new version of the template
            to include rule #define statements.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug with the 'Export to Web Page' utility. The system would sometimes report an
            overflow error if the source grammar was exported. Special thanks to Jens Olesen for
            reporting the error.</li>
          <li>Fixed a minor bug in the 'Replace' edit window. When the window is loaded, any text
            highlighted in the grammar editor window should be copied into the 'Find' textbox.
            However, the text was being copied into the 'Replace' textbox.</li>

        <p>Like the original it should compile with any ANSI C compiler, however this version has

        more memory and CPU cycles than the original project, especially if large files are
        parsed. Where memory is limited, this project could be easily modified to output the parse
        tree as a binary file. </p>

        <p><a href="../contributors/index.htm">Justin Holmes</a> developed a version of the GOLD
        Parser Engine using ANSI C. The new version is not platform dependent, and has been tested
        to compile cleanly on Windows<sup>TM</sup> and Linux. The Parse() method returns the
        actual rule reduced rather than a result code. -1 is returned for a parse error. The
        download also includes a well-commented example program that prints the tokens and rules
        as it matches them.</td>

        GOLD Parser Builder 2.5.1 was released</p>
        <p>This is a very minor update to the Builder. Most of the changes regard the Export to
        Webpage utility.<ul>
          <li>The 'Export to Webpage' utility was improved. The format of the generated tables was
            improved slightly. Column headers are now displayed with a different style than the body
            cells. The window also allows more control in selecting colors. Some of the 'Presets' were
            updated and renamed. Many of these were based on different counties in the California
            Republic.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug when reassigning parameters. The parameters were not being completely reset
            when a new grammar was loaded. As a result, the system generated erroneous warnings.</li>
        </ul>
