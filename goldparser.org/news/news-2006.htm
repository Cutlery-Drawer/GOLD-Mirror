        <p>This release fixes a&nbsp; bug and adds a number of improvements. The changes include
        the following:<ul>
          <li>The import grammar utility now supports Bison. The new version can import grammars
            written in either YACC or Bison. In addition, the system displays the import progress on
            screen.</li>
          <li>Added a 'prior definition' warning for rules. If a rule is defined in two different
            locations, the system will now log a warning. Often, for large grammars, it is easy to
            accidentally create rules with the same name.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug in some of the pre-defined character sets. The bug affected the {ANSI
            Printable}, {All Valid}, and {Control Codes} sets. Special thanks to Bill White for
            reporting the bug.</li>

        originally designed by the United States Department of defense under the&nbsp;supervision
        of the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL) Committee. Most of the groundwork
        and design of COBOL was done by Admiral Grace Hopper of the United States Navy.</p>
        <p>The COBOL 85 grammar is complex - containing, over 350 reserved words, 950 rules which
        results in 1,681 LALR states.</p>

        The grammar for C# was added</p>
        <p>C# was primarily the work of computer scientist Anders Hejlsberg who has worked on a
        wide range of programming languages. These include, but are not limited to, Visual J++,
        Borland Delphi and Turbo Pascal. His previous works and influences from Java and C++ can
        be seen in C#.</p>
        <p>The grammar was designed, in part, using the official language specification that can
        be found on the Microsoft website. As a result, considerable time was required to write a
        LALR(1) compliant version. </p>

        Version 3.1.1 of the Builder was released</p>
        <p>This release fixes a few minor bugs and adds a number of improvements. The changes
        include the following:<ul>
          <li>The system now remembers the window size. Each time the application is closed, the
            current size of the window is now saved into the Registry. </li>
          <li>You can now specify if the printer font will be bold. Before, only the font name and
            size could be specified.</li>
          <li>Rob van den Brink's Pascal engine template is now included.&nbsp; The template creates a
            full-functioning program that does not require you to load a Compiled Grammar Table
            file.&quot;</li>
          <li>Updated the Help Icon. The new version is a basic blue rounded-box. It is far simpler -
            and far more aesthetically appealing - than the last version.</li>
          <li>Fixed an editor bug when a CGT was loaded. I was not disabling all the edit features
            when a CGT was loaded. This was a minor bug.</li>
          <li>Some buttons were not disabled when a CGT was loaded. When a CGT is loaded, the 'save'
            button needed to be disabled. </li>
          <li>A rare 'printer selection' bug was fixed. If the name of the printer is over 32
            characters, the system was not able to properly select it. </li>
          <li>Fixed a printing word-wrap bug. In very rare situations, the system would not word-wrap
            a line before the text entered the right margin.</li>

        <p>This release fixes a few minor bugs and adds a number of improvements. The changes
        include the following:<ul>
          <li>The Options Window was improved. You can now specify the font used in the Test Window
            and the various tables.</li>
          <li>Program templates were improved.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>The startup size of the main window was changed. When the application first loaded, the
            size of the main window was a tad small.</li>
          <li>The startup (Modified) flag was fixed. When the Builder first loads, it puts a short
            comment description in the grammar window. The system was setting the 'Modified' flag to
            true. </li>
          <li>Fixed a bug when parsing large test files. When more than 16k reductions were performed,
            the system would crash.&nbsp; Special thanks to Bob Moore for his help.</li>

        programming language that is able to call windows functions such as C/C++, Visual Basic,
        Delphi etc. The package contains 3 forms of the software: </em><ol>

        <p>The following is the key features of version 2.0 (copied and pasted from his website).<ul>
          <li>Parser is designed to be a &quot;pull&quot; parser, where client programs pulls data out
            of parser. </li>
          <li>Parser keeps only minimum information required for parsing. So, it can be used for
            parsing large files without allocating a lot of memory. </li>
          <li>Parser uses TextReader as a text input. So it can use StringReader or StreamReader
            classes. </li>
          <li>Parser implements &quot;lazy&quot; string allocation for tokens. So, if token text is
            not important then no extra string allocation will be done. </li>
          <li>There is a special Grammar class which can be initialized from CGT file once and reused
            for multiple parsing operations. </li>
          <li>All Grammar properties and tables are immutable. </li>
          <li>Parser uses special transition vectors for DFA and LALR processing to make them faster.
            It is especially optimized for a case where ASCII charset is used. It uses char value as
            an index in array. </li>
          <li>Parser object has to be created for each parsing string or stream. </li>
          <li>Parser has special parse messages to collect comments. </li>
          <li>Callback function can be supplied to collect source lines. </li>
